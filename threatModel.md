Think of another threat model, and write a summary of it as if you were going to send it as a professional email to explain it to a coworker. Suggested ~1-2 paragraphs length, and addressing the core concepts (adversaries, attack surface and vector, and what sort of specific attacks and risks the user faces).

    Hey Steve,

    I just wanted to inform you on our Threat Model we have here at this splendid company. A Threat Model is a systematic approach towards cyber threats and attacks that could potentially happen. In consideration of the incredible product we create a here at this amazing enterprise, we have become a high-valued target for adversaries of elite foreign hackers to attempt in gaining access to our databases and even our sesitive files shared within emails. The best way to prevent such information being compromised is close off this `attack vector` by having a highly secure and randomized password with a proper software to store this password, I recommend Diceware to create the password and KeePass to manage them. This helps create a lesser chance of getting your password cracked.

    Be sure to always have your Firewall enabled to decrease the `attack surface` of your envirnment, such as keeping certain ports closed or pretected from forign entry. To also mitigate attacks on your computer be sure to check the certificates of certain software to ensure they meet the requirements of good security and keeping important data on portable drives and offline and only used when in a secure network. A 2 stage factor authorization will also be implemented to further keep the data safe.

    Please follow these rules, Steve. I wouldn't want your family to be in any type of danger by simple and silly mistakes.
    
    Do what is best for you and most importantly, this insanely amazing coorporation we have created.

    Thank you,

    Me
